R code replicating the data analysis from our paper "On Estimation and Crossâ€“validation of Dynamic Treatment Regimes with Competing Risks" (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.9568) on a synthetic data set from the R package ltmle [[1]](#1). The data set has been modified to include a competing event (see data preparation part in the R code).
